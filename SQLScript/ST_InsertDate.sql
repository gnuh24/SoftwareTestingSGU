Do Celebrities Make Disastrous Role Models?
I believe not all celebrities are disastrous role models, but some can indeed have a negative influence. Many celebrities live in the public eye, and the pressure of maintaining fame can lead to behavior that is not ideal for young, impressionable fans to mimic. The research you mentioned suggests that some celebrities, particularly reality TV stars, are more narcissistic and may promote self-serving behavior. This can create unhealthy expectations and values in their audience, especially younger people.

On the other hand, many celebrities use their platforms to advocate for important causes, spread kindness, and motivate people to be their best selves. These celebrities can serve as positive examples, demonstrating that fame can be used for good.

Good Role Models
Some celebrities stand out as excellent role models due to their advocacy, charity work, and personal values:

Emma Watson: As a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, she promotes gender equality and launched the "HeForShe" campaign. Her focus on education, empowerment, and responsible use of her platform makes her a positive influence.
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson: Known for his hard work, determination, and kindness, he motivates fans to stay healthy, work hard, and be positive. He also supports various charities and is admired for his humble nature despite his success.
Greta Thunberg: Although a young activist rather than a traditional celebrity, she has become a global figure advocating for climate change awareness. She uses her fame to inspire younger generations to take action and raise awareness of important issues.
These celebrities set examples by focusing on societal contributions and personal integrity.

Bad Role Models
On the flip side, some celebrities have displayed behaviors that could be harmful for fans to emulate:

Kanye West: Despite his artistic talent, his public outbursts, erratic behavior, and controversial comments can be confusing for young fans who might mistake such actions as acceptable ways to handle personal challenges.
Jake Paul: The YouTube star has been criticized for promoting risky and dangerous behavior, disrespecting communities, and engaging in various controversies, which can influence his young audience in negative ways.
These celebrities can be seen as poor role models because their behavior often lacks accountability, responsibility, or consideration for their audience.



Who do you admire among your friends and family?
Do you have a role model?

Among my family, I admire my cousin Laura the most. She's incredibly hardworking and dedicated to her passions. Not only is she a talented dancer who trains every day, but she also studies photography at university, where she has won awards for her work. Her ability to balance these two demanding pursuits while remaining confident and focused inspires me a lot.

As for role models, Laura is definitely someone I look up to. Her determination, work ethic, and creativity are qualities I deeply respect, and I admire how she balances her ambitions with her personal life.
